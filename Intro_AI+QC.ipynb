    "Welcome to quantum computing! Here you will get a brief and quick overview of quantum computing, and how you can use your AI exprerience to explore challenges in the quantum landscape. To learn more, head on over to [qBook](qbook.qbraid.com). \n",

    "### Quantum Bits vs Classical Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), **quantum bits (qubits)** can exist in a *superposition* of states:\n",
    "- Classical bit: `|0‚ü©` or `|1‚ü©`\n",
    "- Qubit: `Œ±|0‚ü© + Œ≤|1‚ü©` where `|Œ±|¬≤ + |Œ≤|¬≤ = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: if a classical neural network processes definite inputs, a quantum circuit processes probabilistic amplitudes that can interfere constructively or destructively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Circuits as Computational Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits are surprisingly similar to neural network architectures:\n",
    "- **Gates** (like RX, CNOT) = activation functions/layers\n",
    "- **Qubits** = channels/neurons\n",
    "- **Circuit depth** = network depth\n",
    "- **Measurements** = output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Quantum Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Entanglement**: Qubits become correlated in ways impossible classically\n",
    "2. **Interference**: Probability amplitudes can cancel out (like attention mechanisms)\n",
    "3. **Measurement**: Collapses superposition to classical outcomes\n",
    "4. **No-cloning**: Can't copy quantum states (unlike classical data)\n",
    "\n",

    "- Result: Exponential degradation with circuit depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Error Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical approaches include:\n",
    "- **Zero Noise Extrapolation**: Run at different noise levels, extrapolate to zero\n",
    "- **Symmetry Verification**: Use problem symmetries to detect errors\n",
    "- **Clifford Data Regression**: Learn noise from efficiently simulable circuits\n",
    "\n",
